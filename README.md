## Polygenic risk for schizophrenia: from the Paleolithic to the post-Neolithic

This study investigated the evolutionary dynamics of polygenic risk scores (PRS) for schizophrenia in ancient human populations, 
analyzing genomes spanning from the Early Upper Paleolithic to the Post-Neolithic period.
The results revealed significant fluctuations in PRS over time, with a reduction observed during the Paleolithic and a notable increase from the Neolithic onward.

# These variations appear to be related to changes in selective pressures and social transformations brought about by the advent of agriculture and the growth of sedentary societies. During the Paleolithic, negative selection may have reduced the frequency of schizophrenia risk alleles, reflecting the need for social cohesion and cognitive skills in small hunter-gatherer groups. In contrast, in the Neolithic, increasing social complexity and the development of caregiving practices may have favored the persistence of genetic variants associated with schizophrenia. Additionally, demographic factors such as population bottlenecks, founder effects, and genetic drift may have influenced the distribution of these alleles over time. The study also highlights the relevance of Neanderthal DNA introgression in modern genetic composition and its possible impact on psychiatric disorders. The integration of ancient genomic data with emerging technologies and advanced analytical methodologies offers new perspectives for understanding the evolution of complex conditions such as schizophrenia. The findings underscore the importance of including diverse populations in genetic studies and adopting interdisciplinary approaches to investigate the interplay between genetic, cultural, and environmental factors. This work contributes to understanding the evolutionary foundations of schizophrenia, emphasizing the complex relationship between genetic and social evolution.
