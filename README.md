## Polygenic risk for schizophrenia: from the Paleolithic to the post-Neolithic

This study investigated the evolutionary dynamics of polygenic risk scores (PRS) for schizophrenia in ancient human populations, 
analyzing genomes spanning from the Early Upper Paleolithic to the Post-Neolithic period.
The results revealed significant fluctuations in PRS over time, with a reduction observed during the Paleolithic and a notable increase from the Neolithic onward.
**Keywords:** schizophrenia, polygenic risk, ancient DNA, human evolution, Neanderthal introgression, selective pressures.
